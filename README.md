Rename dinput8.dll to d3d9.dll!

Place the .asi file in the root folder of the game or scripts (create it if it doesn't exist)

# Features:

- You can now perform long headshots using any firearm 
- Shotgun, Shotgun + Torch and Sawn Off Shotgun can be used to blow heads off at close distance (just like Manhunt)
